Java Strings:
------------

-> String is a collection/sequence of characters
-> String is predefined class from 'java.lang' package
-> String is a immutable class, because the class declared with final keyword
   when we create string object their object value cannot modifiable/changeable.
   
   Note: if we are trying to modify/add new string to existing string object, 
         then it will create the new string object.
         
-> in java if we needed class to change the string object value, 
   then the better option is StringBuffer/String Builder.
   
=> in java we can create String objects in two ways,

1. using 'new' keyword
2. by literal way.
